Important
==========
First time users are strongly advised to read the `Getting started guide`_  which explains how to properly configure PyDev



Release 2.2.4
===============

**Cython**

    * Cython is now supported in PyDev (.pyx files may be opened with the PyDev editor).  


**Globals Token Browser (Ctrl+Shift+T)**

    * Packages/Modules can now be reached through the globals browser (so, __init__.py files can now be easily gotten through the package they represent)
    

**Handling external files**

    * External libraries configured in a project appearing in the PyDev Package Explorer
    * Show in > PyDev Package Explorer working for files that are under the interpreter or external libraries.
    * Show in > PyDev Package Explorer working for files inside .zip archives.
    * External files that were opened when Eclipse is closed are properly reopened.

**Editor**

    * New option in the code-formatter to only apply code-formatting on changed lines on save.
    * from __future__ import now properly appears as first even if grouping is enabled.
    * it's now possible to have a minimap of the code in the overview ruler (enable in preferences > PyDev > Editor > Overview Ruler Minimap).
    
**Unittest runner**

    * exc_clear() no longer called if it's not available.
    * Fixed issue where class tearDown was executed twice.


**Debugger**

    * It's now possible to enable/disable stepping into properties while in the debugger. Menu: Run > Disable step into properties (patch by Hussain Bohra)
    * Show in outline view activated in debug perspective  (patch by Hussain Bohra)
    * Watch expressions can be properly expanded in the watch view (patch by Hussain Bohra)
    * Breakpoints in external files are properly shown.
    * Remote debugger: starting the remote debugger no longer shows a launch configuration
    * Remote debugger: when the server is stopped, the server socket is properly closed
    

**Minors**

    * Fixed issue in rename (Alt+Shift+R) / find references (Ctrl+Shift+G) on top level module variables.
    * Fixed issue where create class/method/field action was not ok because of comment.
    * Fixed issue where doing create class/method/field action on file with tabs ended up adding spaces.
