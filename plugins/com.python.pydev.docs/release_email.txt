Details on its development: http://pydev.blogspot.com

Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

Interactive console:

  *  It's now possible to use the interactive console attached to a debug session. (patch from Hussain Bohra)
        To use this feature either right-click a frame in the debug view and choosing PyDev > Debug console or create a new Interactive console as usual (Ctrl+Alt+Enter and choose 'PyDev Debug Console' -- but note that this option will only be enabled when in a debug session with a selected frame in the Debug view.
  *  Fixed issue where completions from the console did not work properly with '%' because quoting was not being properly done.
  *  Fixed issue where the execfile() redefinition in the PyDev console did not use the proper globals
  *  When launching interactive console, PYTHONPATH order is properly kept (patch from James Blackburn).
  *  Fix pasting into the middle of the console (patch from James Blackburn).
  *  For paste, only go to the end of the line if the cursor isn't in range (patch from James Blackburn).

PyUnit:

  *  Improved preferences page configuration (links shown to add options).
  *  Improved test discovery in PyDev PyUnit runner (exclude/include files/tests options added).

Jython:

  *  print may be used in dotted names as Jython requires for grammars 2.4 and 2.5.

Others:

  *  In a build, PyDev could end up reading the contents of files unrelated to Python.
  *  Django project startup compatible with django 1.4.
  *  Assignments to builtins when in the class-level no longer generate a warning.
  *  Fixed issue starting new thread in the debugger (fix for paste/waitress).
  *  Fixed error configuring interpreter if os.path was not present.
  *  Fixed issue when configuring interpreter which has unicode characters in the PYTHONPATH.
  *  When searching for external files, also take a look at the configured projects, as it may be that the file should actually be found in an external source folder.
  *  Fixed issues getting marker on files with a dirty editor and where we could end up getting markers from other files.
  *  The scripting output console is not shown unless there's actually some output to show.
  *  A bunch of other minor fixes.



What is PyDev?
