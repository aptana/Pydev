The model represents the structure of the python file.

<p>{@link ModelMaker ModelMaker} 
creates the model from AST by traversing the tree.
<p>{@link  ModelUtils}
have various utility functions for model traversal, etc.
<p>{@link org.python.pydev.editor.model.AbstractNode AbstractNode}
is the main node API. Subclasses modify it as needed. See
ClassNode, FunctionCallNode, etc...
<p>The definitions of local variables are inferred. The first
mention of every local variable (implicit definition) is stored
inside Scope. Scope is intended for repository of inferred data.
<p>We still need to work on processing of the include modules.
