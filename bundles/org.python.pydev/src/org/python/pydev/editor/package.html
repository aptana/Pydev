The main editor widget and its helper classes.

<p>The main widget is {@link org.python.pydev.editor.PyEdit PyEdit}. It ties other
utility classes together, sets error markers.
<p>PyContentAssistant & PyContentAssisProcessors are dummy classes,
avaiting implementation.
<h3>Design notes</h3>
<p>I really want to implement ctrl-click navigation. It is not as easy
as pluging in a new class to PyEditConfiguration. This one
See JavaEditor::MouseClickListener (set breakpoint at highlightRegion if debugging to see it in action)

<pre>
To implement navigation/completion.
- Each editor needs a vocabulary. The vocabulary is hierarchical in structure, and
has items:
Top-level (file vocabulary) has:
 classes
 functions
 globals?
Class vocabulary has:
 documentation string
 classes
 methods (functions)
 instance variables (inferred from self.)
Method/function vocabulary has:
 documentation string
 locals
 classes
 functions

Each definition in the vocabulary describes:
- where is it defined (file, char span)
- character range where it is applicable

Vocabulary usage:
Find an innermost vocabulary containing current selection.
Then quiz it for whatever is needed
