This is the new code completion.

It is almost completely java-powered (except for the need to get completion tips on dlls from cpython).

The main class here is based on the IASTManager.
Its purpose is to manage the modules and completions based on the AST (if source file) or other methods (if compiled module).

All should be delta based. This is:
- We set the pythonpath and it gets all modules, but loads None.
- When a module is requested, we start a process to get its AST or compleitons if it is compiled.
