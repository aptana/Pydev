To test a single method, a system property called "filter" should be set before running the tests.
E.g.: add -Dfilter=testExtractMethodGlobalDeclared.py to the vm arguments


Bug related to ParameterReturnDeduce: 
	The test testExtractMethodGlobalDeclared.py tests both situations below:

	- It is not considering the globals in the file (builtins/others).
	Basically:
		private void deduceParameters(List<SimpleAdapter> before, List<SimpleAdapter> selected)
	should check if a parameter found is actually a global before adding it to the list of parameters
	
	- If a local variable has only write access, it does not need to be added to the parameters
