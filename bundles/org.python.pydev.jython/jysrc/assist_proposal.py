"""Convenience module for scripting PyDev Quick Assist proposals in Jyton.

USAGE
=====
Create pyedit_*.py file in your jython script dir of choice, import this 
module, subclass AssistProposal, instantiate it and register the instance 
with Pydev. 

Example:
-------------------------------------------------------------
from assist_proposal import AssistProposal, register_proposal

class MyProposal(AssistProposal):
    implementation_goes_here

register_proposal(MyProposal())
-------------------------------------------------------------

The cmd variable is provided automatically by pydev and will be a string 
such as 'onSave' or 'onCreateActions' etc...

See docs in source for further details.
