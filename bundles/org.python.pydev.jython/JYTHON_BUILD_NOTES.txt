Jython 2.2.1 is now compiled directly with PyDev (sources copyright maintained):

    - as PyDev cannot upgrade to the latest Jython (2.5) because it became too big (the jar has 8MB from 1MB in Jython 2.2.1), an upgrade
      was done for Jython 2.2.1 (with sources), so, performance improvements can be done in the Jython internal version of PyDev
      (and some things not needed in PyDev may be stripped out -- such as the servlet and sql support).

    - The Lib is available in Jython 2.2.1 (installed it with sources and added the sources under src_jython). 
    
    optparse.py and textwrap.py were gotten from Python 2.4/Lib.
    
    
Also, it seems this was the last version with a grammar close to the PyDev grammar, so, some performance improvements 
from the PyDev grammar were added to it (i.e.: FastCharStream).
