This package handles processing after user presses "Run" button on launch until
the program gets launched.<p>

<p>It integrates with the org.eclipse.debug LaunchConfiguration framework (Debug menus etc).
<p>PythonRunActionDelegate gets called by the popup menu.
<p>It creates LaunchShortcut, which displays the "How do you want to launch" dialog.
<p>Finally, LaunchShortcut tells PythonLaunchConfigurationDelegate to launch the file.
<p>PythonLaunchConfigurationDelegate passes all the parameters to PythonRunnerConfig,
<p>and creates PythonRunner.
<p>PythonRunner launches the executable and connects it to internal debug model.
