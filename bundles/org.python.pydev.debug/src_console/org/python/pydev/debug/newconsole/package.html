The difference from the 'new' interactive console to the old is that this console will have a much better handling on
how things work. The old version was basically a wrapper around python.exe. The only thing that was worth on it was that
it did send code from the editor to the shell.

This console should also contain: code-completion, description of things on hover.

For that, it'll create a process executing a script that'll be able to provide those things from a
xml communication.
