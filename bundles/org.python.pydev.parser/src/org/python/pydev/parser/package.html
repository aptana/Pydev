Pydev interface to Python parser.

<p>Every {@link org.python.pydev.editor.PyEdit PyEdit} has a PyParser associated with it.
The parser continuously parses the input into AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). 
Listeners can register with PyParser to receive events when parse is complete.
<p>Instead of using the parse tree directly, try {@link org.python.pydev.editor.model} first
