Ok, now that you're already up and running with PyDev, there are some
useful tips presented below to make your coding more enjoyable:

-  **Learn the keybindings provided by PyDev and Eclipse**: As with any
   other environment, you'll have to learn what can be done (and how).
   In the reference manual, there is a session dedicated just to that...

-  **Search for what you need**: Eclipse is a platform that has
   literally hundreds of plugins. If you want something that you are
   missing, search for it... you never know what you can find!

-  If there is something you **wish PyDev had**, but it doesn't, drop a
   note at the `feature request
   tracker <https://sw-brainwy.rhcloud.com>`_...
   who knows, it might be the next implemented feature :)

And that's it... if you got here, you already 'graduated' to the
'intermediate level'... You can continue on to the reference manual,
which will present you the features that are available within PyDev and
give you much more information on how to effectively use your platform.
