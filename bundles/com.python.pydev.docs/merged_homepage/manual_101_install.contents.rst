Note for users with LiClipse
==========================================

PyDev already comes preinstalled in `LiClipse <http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse/>`_, so, this step can be skipped
(note that if `LiClipse <http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse/>`_ is
used, PyDev cannot be installed or update separately, as it must always be
updated as a whole).

Before starting the install
===========================

The first thing to choose before the install is a folder where you have
permissions to write (otherwise, remember to install Eclipse running as an Administrator and remember to
run as an Administrator whenever any plugin needs to be updated).

Also, it seems Eclipse 3.6.0 has some issues installing in shared
locations (in any OS). An example of such a location would be the Program Files directory on Windows (see:
`https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show\_bug.cgi?id=322929 <https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=322929>`_),
so, please use at least 3.6.1 if planning to install Eclipse/PyDev on a
shared location.

PyDev Certificate
=================

PyDev is built with a self-signed certificate, which means that when
installed a dialog will be opened to ask if you trust the certificate (which should be OK for most users).

Now, if you don't want that dialog to appear, it's possible to import
the certificate before starting the installation process (this is actually a requirement for those that want to install PyDev
from the command line because of a bug in the Eclipse p2 director).

The first step for that is downloading the `PyDev
certificate <pydev_certificate.cer>`_.

The second step is discovering the java being used in Eclipse: go to
**Help > About > Installation details and look for 'java.home'**

Then to actually import it, in the command line, go to the Eclipse
'java.home' directory and execute

**bin/keytool.exe -import -file pydev\_certificate.cer -keystore
lib/security/cacerts**

Note that if you never did anything here, your **password** when
requested should be **changeit**

Reference:
`http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html#cacerts <http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/solaris/keytool.html#cacerts>`_

Installing with the update site
===============================

**Note: Instructions are targeted at Eclipse 3.5 onwards**

To install PyDev and PyDev Extensions using the Eclipse Update Manager,
you need to use the **Help > Install New Software...** menu (note that in older versions, 
this would be the 'Find and Install'
menu).

In the next screen, add the update site(s) you want to work with (
**See below for a list with the available update sites**).

.. figure:: http://pydev.org/images/update_sites.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 


Available update sites
======================

Main:

-  `http://pydev.org/updates <http://pydev.org/updates>`_

Nightly builds:

-  `http://pydev.org/nightly <http://pydev.org/nightly>`_

After entering the update sites, select the update site you entered or
select "All available sites" and add a filter for PyDev, so that it
shows the contents of all the update sites that have PyDev, then select
what you want to install and click 'Next'.

|image1|

Then, **UNCHECK** the **'Contact all update sites during install to
find required software'** and press
'Next' again to confirm your selection.

|image2|

And finally, read the license agreement and if you accept, select the
accept radio button and click 'Finish'.

|image3|

At that point, Eclipse should automatically download the plugin
contents and present you to a dialog asking
if you want to restart (to which you should say **yes**).

Possible issue on download
==========================

If you have any problem at this point with a message such as:

    An error occurred while collecting items to be installed
     No repository found containing:
      org.python.pydev/osgi.bundle/1.4.7.2843
     No repository found containing:
      org.python.pydev.ast/osgi.bundle/1.4.7.2843

that might indicate that the mirror you selected is having some network
problem at that time, so, please follow the same steps with another mirror.

Installing with the zip file
============================

The available locations for the zip files are:

-  `SourceForge
   download <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pydev/files/>`_

After downloading the zip file:

**Eclipse 3.4 onwards**

Extract the contents of the zip file in the **eclipse/dropins** folder
and restart Eclipse.

**Before Eclipse 3.4**

Extract the contents of the zip file on top of Eclipse, making sure the
plugins folder is extracted on top of the **eclipse/plugins** folder and the features is on top of the
**eclipse/features** folder. After that, restart Eclipse with the '-clean' flag, so that Eclipse
finds out about it.

Checking the installation
=========================

You can verify if it is correctly installed going to the menu **'window
> preferences'** and checking if there is a **PyDev** item under that.

Uninstalling
============

Follow the instructons below if at any time you wish to stop using the
PyDev plugin (or any other Eclipse plugin):

**Eclipse 3.5 onwards**

If you installed with the update site, go to the menu **help > about >
installation details** then on the **Installed Software** tab, select the plugins you want to uninstall
and click **Uninstall**.

If you installed with the zip file, just remove the com.python.pydev and
org.python.pydev features and plugins from the dropins folder.

**Before Eclipse 3.4**

Go to the menu **help > software updates > manage configuration**,
select the plugin and click 'disable', then, you have to restart
Eclipse, go to the same place again and then click on 'remove' (note that you
have a button in the menu that enables you to see the 'disabled'
features).

Common Install Problems
=======================

Windows Vista/7 UAC (User Access Control)
=========================================

Eclipse 3.3 had issues with the Windows UAC, so, Eclipse must be run as
Administrator to install a plugin on Eclipse 3.3.

Corrupted install
=================

Eclipse sometimes is not able to correctly get the plugin, from the
update site but will do no checking on whether it is really correct (no md5 checking), and when this
happens, you'll usually get a ClassNotFoundException (similar to the example below).

When that happens, **you should uninstall it and reinstall again** with
the update site... if that still fails, you could try to get the zip files, as it will at
least give you a warning when it is corrupt.

Note that the chance of the files being corrupt in the server is pretty
low, as that's something that's always checked in a new release â€“ but if you're 
suspicious about it, please ask in the forum, so that it can be double-checked.

Also, there have been reports with that error where the only solution
that has been consistent has been **removing all** previous versions of
pydev and then installing the latest version.

**EXAMPLE**

Unable to create this part due to an internal error. Reason for the
failure: The editor class could not be instantiated. This usually indicates that
the editor's class name was mistyped in plugin.xml.
