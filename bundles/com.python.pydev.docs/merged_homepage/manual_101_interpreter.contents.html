<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-ConfigureInterpreter"></a>Configure Interpreter</h1>

<p>After installing it, the first thing you must do is configure the <b>Python and/or Jython and/or IronPython</b> interpreter. <br/>
To configure the interpreter:</p>


<p>1. Go to: <b>window &gt; preferences &gt; PyDev &gt; Interpreter - (Python/Jython/IronPython)</b>.</p>

<p>2. Choose the interpreter you have installed in your computer (such as python.exe, jython.jar or ipy.exe).</p>

<p>   Note that the <b>Auto Config</b> will try to find it in your PATH, but it can fail if it's not there (or if you<br/>
   want to configure a different interpreter).</p>

<p>   On <b>Windows</b> it'll also search the registry and provide a choice based on the multiple interpreters available<br/>
   in your computer (searching in the registry).</p>

<p>   On <b>Linux/Mac</b>, usually you can do a 'which python' to know where the python executable is located.</p>

<p>   On <b>Mac</b> it's usually at some place resembling the image below (so, if you want to configure a different version<br/>
   of the interpreter manually, that's where you'd want to search):</p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="http://pydev.org/images/interpreter_mac.png" style="border: 1px solid black" /></span><br/>
3. Select the paths that will be in your <b>SYSTEM PYTHONPATH</b>. </p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Select only folders that will <b>NOT be used as source folders for any project</b> of yours <br/>
(those should be later configured as source folders in the project).</p>

<p><b>IMPORTANT for Mac users</b>: The Python version that usually ships with Mac doesn't seem to have the .py source files <br/>
available, which are required for PyDev, so, using a different interpreter is recommended (i.e.: Download it from 
<a href="http://python.org" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://python.org</a>). If you don't want to use a different interpreter, get the source files for the Python '/Lib' folder<br/>
and add those to the system installation. </p>

<p>After those steps, you should have a screen as presented below:</p>

<p><span class="image-wrap" style=""><img src="http://pydev.org/images/interpreter.png" style="border: 1px solid black" /></span></p>
<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-Howtocheckiftheinformationwascorrectlygotten"></a>How to check if the information was correctly gotten</h1>

<p>    The <b>System libs</b> must contain at least the Lib and the Lib/site-packages directory.</p>

<p>    The <b>Forced builtin libs</b> must contain the modules built into the interpreter (and others whose<br/>
    analysis should be done dynamically. See: <a href="#PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-ForcedBuiltins">Forced Builtins</a>).</p>


<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-Whatifitisnotcorrect%3F"></a>What if it is not correct?</h1>

<p>    The most common error is having a problem in the environment variables used from the shell that spawned Eclipse,<br/>
    in a way that for some reason when getting the variables of one interpreter, it gathers the info from another<br/>
    interpreter (thus mixing the interpreter and the actual libraries).</p>

<p>    Usually running (from the command prompt) the file that gives that info for PyDev can help you discovering the<br/>
    problem in your configuration (interpreterInfo.py):</p>

<p>        That file is usually located at: eclipse\plugins\org.python.pydev_$version$\pysrc\interpreterInfo.py,<br/>
        but it can be at other location depending on how you installed it )</p>

<p>        python.exe interpreterInfo.py</p>

<p>        java.exe -cp c:\path\to\jython.jar org.python.util.jython interpreterInfo.py </p>

<p>        ipy.exe interpreterInfo.py</p>

<p>    If you're unable to find out what's going on, please ask in the users forum (giving the output obtained from<br/>
    executing interpreterInfo.py in your machine).</p>


<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-WhatifIaddsomethingnewinmySystemPYTHONPATHafterconfiguringit%3F"></a>What if I add something new in my System PYTHONPATH after configuring it?</h1>

<p>    If you add something to your python installation, you need to either<br/>
    add it manually as a 'new folder' in the System PYTHONPATH (if it's still not under a folder in the PYTHONPATH)<br/>
    or <b>(recommended) remove your interpreter and add it again</b>, then, press apply.</p>

<p>    Note that if you added a library that's already under a folder in the PYTHONPATH, you have to at least go to<br/>
    the interpreter preferences and press apply so that it clears its internal caches (after the configuration<br/>
    is done, things are set in stone for PyDev) </p>


<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-Libraries"></a>Libraries</h1>

<p>    The <b>System libs</b> are the libraries that will be added to the PYTHONPATH of any project that is using this interpreter.</p>

<p>    For <b>Python and IronPython</b>, it's composed of <b>folders, zip files and egg files</b>. Note that if dlls should be added to<br/>
    the PYTHONPATH, the folders actually containing those dlls should be added, and they must have the same name to be<br/>
    imported in the code (the case is important). I.e.: if you want to import iTextDll, it <b>must</b> be called iTextDll.dll<br/>
    (note that .pyd and .so extensions are also accepted).</p>

<p>    For <b>Jython</b>, it's composed of <b>folders and jars</b>.</p>


<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-ForcedBuiltins"></a><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-ForcedBuiltins"></a>Forced Builtins</h1>

<p>    The Forced builtin libs are the libraries that are built-in the interpreter, such as <b>_<em>builtin</em>_, sha, etc</b> or<br/>
    libraries that should forcefully analyzed through a shell (i.e.: to analyze modules in this list, PyDev will spawn<br/>
    a shell and do a dir() on the module to get the available tokens for completions and code-analysis) &#8211; still, <br/>
    sometimes even that is not always possible, in which case, <a href="#PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-PredefinedCompletions">Predefined Completions</a> may be used to let PyDev know <br/>
    about the structure of the code.</p>

<p>    For <b>Python</b>, you should have around <b>50</b> entries </p>

<p>    For <b>Jython</b> around <b>30</b> entries.</p>

<p>    For <b>IronPython</b> more than <b>100</b> entries. All the packages built into .NET should be included here &#8211; e.g.:<br/>
    Microsoft, Microsoft.Windows.Themes, System, System.IO, etc. </p>

<p>    Additionally, you may add other libraries that you want to treat as <br/>
    builtins, such as <b>os, wxPython, OpenGL, etc</b>. This is very important, because PyDev works <br/>
    on the java side only with static information, but some modules don't have much information when analyzed <br/>
    statically, so, PyDev creates a shell to get information on those. Another important<br/>
    thing is that they <b>must</b> be on your system pythonpath (otherwise, the shell will be unable to get that information). </p>

<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-PredefinedCompletions"></a><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-PredefinedCompletions"></a>Predefined Completions</h1>

<p>    Predefined completions are completions acquired from sources that provide only the interfaces for<br/>
    a given Python module (with Python 3.0 syntax).</p>

<p>    A predefined completion module may be created by having a module with the extension ".pypredef"<br/>
    with regular Python 3.0 contents, but with attributes having assigns to its type and methods having<br/>
    as the body a sole return statement &#8211; and the docstring may have anything.</p>

<p>    Example for a <b>my.source.module</b> (must be declared in a <b>my.source.module.pypredef</b> file):</p>

<p>    <b>Note 1</b>: the name of the file is the exact name of the module</p>

<p>    <b>Note 2</b>: .pypredef files are not searched in subfolders</p>

<p>    <b>Optionally a QScintilla .api file may be added</b>. When this is done, PyDev will try to create <br/>
    .pypredef files from that .api file and will add the folder containing those to the PYTHONPATH.<br/>
    Note that this conversion is still in beta and the file may not be correctly generated, so,<br/>
    keep an eye for errors logged when a code-completion that would use those modules (while it<br/>
    will not fail, those completions won't be shown using the .pypredef files).<br/>
    In those situations, please create a bug-report with the .api file that generated incorrect code.</p>

<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-Environment"></a>Environment</h1>

<p>    The variables defined at the environment will be set as environment variables when running a script that uses the <br/>
    given interpreter (note    that it can still be overridden in the run configuration)</p>


<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-Stringsubstitutionvariables"></a>String substitution variables</h1>

<p>    Strings defined here may be used in:</p>

<ul>
	<li>project configuration for source folders and external libraries</li>
	<li>launch configuration for the main module</li>
</ul>


<p>    They can be used in those places in the format: ${DECLARED_VARIABLE}</p>


<h1><a name="PyDevInterpreterConfiguration-Cygwinusers"></a>Cygwin users</h1>

<p>    PyDev currently has no support for cygwin. Currently you'll be able to configure the interpreter <br/>
    with cygwin, but there are still other related problems (mostly on converting between windows and cygwin paths as needed).</p>
