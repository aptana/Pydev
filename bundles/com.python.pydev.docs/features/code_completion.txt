Code Completion
===============

Context-Sensitive
-----------------

Current code completion (context-sensitive) features should be kept

Additions:
- completing on method returns (the method called should be analyzed to know what can it return).
- local imports should be considered when doing the code completion - OK
- make code completion for call-tips (inside parentesis):
	- should happen right after a parentesis or after a comma inside a parentesis


Not context-sensitive and Auto-import
-------------------------------------

The not context-sensitive code completion should work toghether with the auto-import feature. - OK

What will it contain:
- modules available - OK
- classes defined in the global scope - OK
- methods defined in the global scope - OK
- pydoc should show in analyzed files
- methods should have parameters by default
- classes should have parameters by default because of constructor

Concerns
--------

- user should be able to select the number of characters that should be in the activation token in order to get 
the not context-sensitive completions
- compiled modules (the tokens for compiled modules will not appear -- only the compiled modules themselves)
