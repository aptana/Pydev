Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

* The type inference engine now accepts comments in the format **#@type a: str** to get the type.

* Interpreter configuration properly deals with characters with ampersand.

* Interactive console can now work with PySide and wxPython to create widgets without blocking.

* Debugger now working properly with Jython 2.1.

* Markups in sphinx or epydoc format can now have a different color in docstrings.

* Code-completion for the sphinx markup is provided in docstrings.

* Fixed issue when resolving module names (which could make PyDev find modules as Lib.math instead of math if the interpreter folder was added to the PYTHONPATH and not only the Lib folder).

* When configuring project source folders (PYTHONPATH), it's possible to make use of the PROJECT_DIR_NAME variable.

* **Patches by Trey Greer**:

	* PyLint 1.0 is now properly supported.

* **Patches by Jonah Graham:**

	* Fixed issue in interactive console interaction with XML-RPC.

	* Interactive console history is saved to persistent location.

	* It's possible to filter variables in the variables view menu (can be activated with Ctrl+F10 focusing the variables view > PyDev, select/deselect filters).

	* Eclipse variables are expanded in the initial interpreter commands for the interactive console.

	* An evaluate button (same as Ctrl+Alt+Enter) is now available in the toolbar.

* **Patches by by Anselm Kruis:**

	* Fixed issues related to having the interpreter or workspace in locations with non-ascii characters.

* **Patches by Jeremy Carroll:**

	* It's now possible to use PEP-8 style imports (default now, can be unconfigured at window > preferencs > pydev > editor > code style > imports).

	* It's possible to configure the organize imports to remove unused imports (must be enabled in window > preferencs > pydev > editor > code style > imports).

* **Patches by Andrew Ferrazzutti:**

	* Better heuristics to discover file in workspace related to open files when debugging.

	* Improvements in the PyDev project configuration and wizard.

	* It's possible to mark/unmark folders as source folders with a right-click context menu.

	* Auto-Configuration of interpreter streamlined.

* **Patches by Andre Berg:**

	* It's possible to have a change action which will keep a variable updated when file is changed (i.e.: __date__ = '2013-01-01' would be updated when file is saved to a new date).


What is PyDev?
---------------------------

PyDev is a plugin that enables users to use Eclipse for Python, Jython and IronPython development -- making Eclipse a first class Python IDE -- It comes with many goodies such as code completion, syntax highlighting, syntax analysis, refactor, debug and many others.
